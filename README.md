# skeleton
A skeleton app, or a template for Flutter Authentication with Bloc and Clean Architecture. 
I'd say this is an acceptable approach for authentication as it only depends on firebase in the Data layer.
## Getting Started
1. Install Flutter
2. Run flutter create .
3. Run make get in bash (git bash on Windows)
4. Do the FlutterFire setup (https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios#available-plugins)
5. Replace the firebase_options.dart file
