# skeleton
The purpose of this app is to create a template for future flutter development which already has a bunch of features implemented
## Getting Started
1. Install Flutter
2. Clone the repository and rename the folder from AuthenticationSkeleton to something without uppercases
3. Replace all occurences of the word "skeleton" with the name of your project
3. Run flutter create .  (make sure the folder you're working in has no capital letters. Rename after cloning or clone into the proper folder)
4. Run make get in bash (git bash on Windows)
5. Do the FlutterFire setup (https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios#available-plugins)
6. Replace the firebase_options.dart file


Near Future:

Safety:
- (❌) Spam protection (action limiting, blocking buttons after first click) - Finding a proper structure for doing that at scale
- (❌) User authorization check on every interaction with the backend 
- (❌) Local data deletion
- (❌) Encryption

Features:
- (❌) Caching
- (❌) Notifications (reminders and notifiers for actions)
- (❌) Authentication with Google, Twitter and apple
- (❌) Localization
- (❌) Deep linking and/or dynamic linking
- (❌) Account recovery
- (❌) Realtime without Firebase
- (❌) Roles (admin, user. Separation of UI in short)

Stability:
- (❌) Error handling and presentation of errors
- (❌) A consistent Presentation layer structure.
- (❌) A consistent Widget reusability.
- (❌) A consistent state management structure.
- (❌) Form validation
- (❌) Routing, navigation and redirecting
- (❌) Working with URLs and stuff
- (❌) Responsive UI
- (❌) Animations (loading for example)
- (❌) Offline mode

Development experience:
- (❌) Best practices in general (Clean Architecture, clean code, etc)
- (❌) Different modes (Production, Development)
- (❌) Performance monitoring, Crashlytics
- (❌) Testing
- (❌) CI/CD
- (❌) Logging (both in production and in development)
- (❌) Bug reporting
- (❌) Admin dashboard, statistics



Long term:
- (❌) Easy way to switch between modes
- (❌) A Create-Next-App type CLI for setting up the app. With different settings and options for features
- (❌) Automatic setup for template
- (❌) Documentation
- (❌) Payment system, different plans
