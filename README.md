# skeleton
A skeleton app, or a template for Flutter Authentication with Bloc and Clean Architecture. 
I'd say this is an acceptable approach for authentication as it only depends on firebase in the Data layer.
## Getting Started
1. Install Flutter
2. Clone the repository and rename the folder from AuthenticationSkeleton to something without uppercases
3. Replace all occurences of the word "skeleton" with the name of your project
3. Run flutter create .
4. Run make get in bash (git bash on Windows)
5. Do the FlutterFire setup (https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios#available-plugins)
6. Replace the firebase_options.dart file
