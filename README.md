# skeleton
A skeleton app, or a template for Flutter Authentication with Bloc and Clean Architecture. 
I'd say this is an acceptable approach for authentication as it only depends on firebase in the Data layer.
## Getting Started
1. Install Flutter
2. Run flutter create .
3. Do the FlutterFire setup
4. Replace the firebase_options.dart file
